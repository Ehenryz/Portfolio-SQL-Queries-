# Rockbuster Stealth LLC (SQL)
Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.
To assist Rockbuster Stealthâ€™s business intelligence (BI) department with the new launch strategy, 
I used SQL to analyze the data and answer ad-hoc business questions from various departments. 
For my project deliverables I created a Powerpoint presentation for Rockbuster Stealth's Management Board, and an Excel report for my technical colleagues. Also, I created a supplemental data dictionary as well. 
## Objective
Use SQL to analyze the data to answer complex business questions with data driven answers for the upcoming online video streaming launch. 
### Key Questions:
* Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
* What was the average rental duration for all videos?
* Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
* Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
* Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
## Data
Rockbuster Dataset (_is a mock dataset created by CareerFoundry for use in this project_)
* Includes data on customers, films, actors, stores, staff, and locations.
